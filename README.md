# 🏫 School Days - Mystery Prototype

> **Concept:** A top-down pixel art adventure game inspired by *Stranger Things* and classic SNES RPGs (Zelda/Earthbound).
## Agent Instructions
Architecture, development, and review agent instructions live in `docs/agents/`. Start with `docs/agents/README.md`.


## 🕵️ The Vision
The game takes place in a seemingly normal school setting. You play as a kid exploring corridors, classrooms, and the schoolyard. However, dark secrets lurk beneath the surface (literally, in the basement).

**Key Elements:**
*   **Vibe:** Normal life meets Supernatural Mystery.
*   **Perspective:** Top-Down 2D.
*   **Visuals:** 16-bit Pixel Art (Procedurally generated for now).
*   **Platform:** Web-based (runs on PC & Mobile).

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

The project is built to be lightweight and easy to extend. We use **Phaser 3** as the engine.

### File Structure

    *   Rendering & Camera.
    *   Physics (Collisions).
    *   Input (WASD + Virtual Joystick for mobile).
    *   Level Loading Logic.
*   **`js/levels.js`**: The Data Layer. Contains:
    *   **Layouts:** ASCII-style arrays representing the map grids.
    *   **Portals:** Coordinates that trigger level changes (Doors/Stairs).
    *   **Metadata:** Colors, Names, Start positions.

### Current Features (v0.2)

## 🗺️ World Map (Current)
1.  **School Yard:** The starting area. Sunny, asphalt, basketball hoops.
2.  **Main Hallway:** Indoors. Lockers (walls) and classrooms. Dimmer lighting.
3.  **The Basement:** Pitch black. Creepy. Requires a flashlight (future feature).

## 🚀 Roadmap / Next Steps
*   **NPCs:** Add teachers and students to talk to.
*   **Lighting Engine:** Make the flashlight mechanic real.
*   **Enemies:** Add the "Rat" or shadow monsters in the basement.
*   **Inventory:** Pick up keys/items.
